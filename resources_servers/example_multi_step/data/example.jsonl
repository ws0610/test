Example\nFor example, if the user query is \"I'm very warm\", the term you should focus on is \"hot\". According to the synonyms above, the term \"hot\" has the synonyms \"Blazing\" and \"Warm\", in that order. You need to get synonym values for \"Blazing\" and \"Warm\", let's say those are 5 and 6 respectively, and extract the result of those synonym values i.e. [5, 6] with 5 (blazing) first then 6 (warm) since that is the order they appear in the list of synonyms above."}, {"role": "user", "content": "In what ways can urban planning reduce the effects of heat islands in major cities?"}], "tools": [{"type": "function", "name": "get_synonym_value", "description": "Get the synonym value for a synonym.\nThis operation returns a value that conforms to the following JSON Schema: {\"properties\": {\"synonym_value\": {\"type\": \"integer\", \"title\": \"Synonym Value\", \"description\": \"The value for this synonym.\"}}, \"type\": \"object\", \"required\": [\"synonym_value\"]}\n", "parameters": {"properties": {"synonym": {"type": "string", "title": "Synonym", "description": "The synonym to get the value for."}}, "type": "object", "required": ["synonym"], "additionalProperties": false}, "strict": true}, {"type": "function", "name": "extract_synonym_values", "description": "Extract the synonym values you retrieved for the term that is relevant to the user query.\nThis operation returns a value that conforms to the following JSON Schema: {\"properties\": {\"success\": {\"type\": \"boolean\", \"title\": \"Success\", \"description\": \"Success.\"}}, \"type\": \"object\", \"required\": [\"success\"]}\n", "parameters": {"properties": {"synonym_values": {"items": {"type": "integer"}, "type": "array", "title": "Synonym Values", "description": "The synonym values corresponding to the term for the user query."}}, "type": "object", "required": ["synonym_values"], "additionalProperties": false}, "strict": true}], "parallel_tool_calls": false}, "expected_synonyms": ["Blazing", "Warm"], "expected_synonym_values": [711, 407], "minefield_label": "Hot", "minefield_label_value": 299}
