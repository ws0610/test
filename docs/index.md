# NeMo Gym Documentation

NeMo Gym is a framework for building reinforcement learning (RL) training environments large language models (LLMs). Gym provides training environment development scaffolding and training environment patterns such as multi-step, multi-turn, and user modeling scenarios.

At the core of NeMo Gym are three server concepts: **Responses API Model servers** are model endpoints, **Resources servers** contain tool implementations and verification logic, and **Response API Agent servers** orchestrate the interaction between models and resources.

## Quickstart

Run a training environment and start collecting rollouts for training in under 5 minutes.

:::{tab-item} 1. Set Up

**Install NeMo Gym**

Get NeMo Gym installed and ready to use:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone git@github.com:NVIDIA-NeMo/Gym.git
cd Gym

# Install UV (Python package manager)
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
source $HOME/.local/bin/env

# Create virtual environment
uv venv --python 3.12
source .venv/bin/activate

# Install NeMo Gym
uv sync --extra dev --group docs
```

**Configure Your API Key**

Create an `env.yaml` file that contains your OpenAI API key and the {term}`Policy Model` you want to use. Replace `your-openai-api-key` with your actual key. This file helps keep your secrets out of version control while still making them available to NeMo Gym.

```bash
echo "policy_base_url: https://api.openai.com/v1
policy_api_key: your-openai-api-key
policy_model_name: gpt-4.1-2025-04-14" > env.yaml
```

:::{tab-item} 2. Start Servers

**Terminal 1** (start servers):

```bash
# Start servers (this will keep running)
config_paths="resources_servers/example_simple_weather/configs/simple_weather.yaml,\
responses_api_models/openai_model/configs/openai_model.yaml"
ng_run "+config_paths=[${config_paths}]"
```

**Terminal 2** (interact with agent):

```bash
# In a NEW terminal, activate environment
source .venv/bin/activate

# Interact with your agent
python responses_api_agents/simple_agent/client.py
```

:::

:::{tab-item} 3. Collect Rollouts

**Terminal 2** (keep servers running in Terminal 1):

```bash
# Create a simple dataset with one query
echo '{"responses_create_params":{"input":[{"role":"developer","content":"You are a helpful assistant."},{"role":"user","content":"What is the weather in Seattle?"}]}}' > weather_query.jsonl

# Collect verified rollouts
ng_collect_rollouts \
    +agent_name=simple_weather_simple_agent \
    +input_jsonl_fpath=weather_query.jsonl \
    +output_jsonl_fpath=weather_rollouts.jsonl

# View the result
cat weather_rollouts.jsonl | python -m json.tool
```

This generates training data with verification scores!

:::{tab-item} 4. Clean Up Servers

**Terminal 1** with the running servers: Ctrl+C to stop the `ng_run` process.
