# Training Framework Integration

This section covers how to integrate NeMo Gym into a new training framework. This content is for expert users who cannot use existing training framework integrations and need to implement their own.

:::{note}
Most users should use an existing integration such as NeMo RL. Refer to these guides only if you are developing a custom RL training framework or need to understand the integration requirements.
:::

## Prerequisites

Before integrating Gym into your training framework, ensure you have:

- An RL training framework with policy optimization support (PPO, GRPO, or similar)
- A generation backend (vLLM, SGLang, or equivalent)
- Familiarity with OpenAI-compatible HTTP server APIs

## Integration Components

Gym integration requires implementing the following components in your training framework:

## Integration Workflow

The typical integration workflow follows this sequence:

```{list-table}
:header-rows: 1
:widths: 10 30 60

* - Step
  - Component
  - Description
* - 1
  - Generation backend
  - Expose your generation engine (vLLM, SGLang) as an OpenAI-compatible HTTP server
* - 2
  - On-policy corrections
  - Implement token ID fixes to prevent re-tokenization and re-templating issues
* - 3
  - Gym integration
  - Connect Gym to your training loop using the rollout orchestration APIs
* - 4
  - Validation
  - Verify integration using the success criteria benchmarks
```
